In the example, I have started with Read of Modbus Holding register value.
Not all specs of Modbus standard are covered. I shall try to cover them in my subsequent uploads.

List of uploads (Refer Github tag for corresponding Chapter):
1. Ch01 : Holding register Read. Basic with exception codes 01, 02,03 implemented.
2. Ch02 : Discrete Coil Read, Discrete Input Read and Analog Input Read are added.
3. Ch03 : Implementation of Inter character break timeout & Inter-frame delay timers for processing of Modbus messages, Calculation & comparision of Received Modbus Frame's CRC
